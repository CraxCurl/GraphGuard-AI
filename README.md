# GraphGuard-AI
The system implements real-time graph-based transaction monitoring to track money mule networks and complex financial crimes which it detects by studying relationship patterns and transaction speed and the complex movement of funds through different payment systems. The system analyzes multiple payment channels to build a unified financial entity graph which Graph Neural Networks use to identify mule ring operations that include structuring, fragmentation, nesting, and cross-border laundering.

Financial criminals exploit fragmented banking systems by rapidly moving money across mobile applications and web banking platforms and UPI and digital wallets and ATMs. The organized mule account networks use high-velocity multi-hop transactions to bypass standard fraud detection rules and conduct cross-channel laundering and structuring and sanctions evasion activities. Most fraud detection systems operate through separate channels which follow predefined rules that fail to detect coordinated financial crimes based on relationships between multiple criminals.

GraphGuard AI solves the challenge through network intelligence which converts transaction monitoring into operational use. The system combines various transaction sources into a single entity graph which shows how accounts and wallets and devices and IP addresses and ATMs and jurisdictions connect with one another. The system detects hidden connections and synchronized movements through its analysis of the active financial network which traditional monitoring systems cannot detect. 

The system monitors transaction speed to detect three types of activities which include sudden transaction weight increases and multiple transfers within brief periods and pass-through transactions.
